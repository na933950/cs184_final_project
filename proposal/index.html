      <h2>Title: Semi-Automated Vector Based 2D Cel Shading</h2>

      <h3>Project Description</h3>
      <p>We will be reimplementing the semi-automatic shading technique for 2D images as described by the paper "2D Shading for Cel Animation" by Hudon et. al. We will improve upon the accuracy of the model while utilizing new shading techniques.</p>

      <h2>Problem Description (including questions we want to answer)</h2>
      <p>
        Optimization of real time shading is important because these processes
        often include lots of simple, repetitive math. There is a lot of room
        for speed up through methods like multithreading/parallelization.
        <br />
        <br />
        The main challenge will be to successfully parallelize the shaders and
        get them to work in real time as we are moving around the environment.
        We are working as well primarily with very heavily stylized shading
        styles, which may require additional workshopping to implement.

        <br />
        <br />
        Cel shading in animation is a relatively new area. We will examine
        previous research papers including 2D Shading for Cel Animation by
        Hudon, Pagés, Grogan, Ondrej, and Smolié, which implements a
        semi-automatic shading tool which can be used for image generation or
        animation. We improve upon this tool by adding multiple light sources
        and using a halftone shading method rather than a block shading method.
        We think that this will be an interesting challenge because a
        semi-automatic shading tool is one that could improve different styles
        of comic art and animation.
      </p>
      <h2>Goals and Deliverables</h2>
      <h3>Baseline Plan</h3>
      <p>
        We plan to generate multiple 2D images using a modified version of cel
        (toon) shaders where the shading is shown via dots (halftone shading)
        rather than blocks (images below). We want to first be able to
        understand how to automate shading systems for 2D images and be able to
        implement self-shadowing techniques while ensuring accuracy. The quality
        of the outcome will be determined by the accuracy of the placement of
        shadows in a rendering of a 2D image. It should also be noted that
        adding additional functionality will possibly cause our system to run
        slower than the one described in the paper and make a difficult final
        comparison in terms of performance.
      </p>
      <h3>Images we hope to Create</h3>
      <p>Here are some examples of images we may hope to create!</p>
      <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center">
        <table
          style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse"
        >
          <tr>
            <td style="text-align: center">

        </table>
      </div>
      <h3>Measuring Performance and Quality</h3>
      <p>
        As a baseline, as we implement the replica version of the cel shader as
        defined by the paper we linked, we will compare our rendering times for
        similar simulations with those listed in the paper. As we attempt to
        both optimize and add functionality to our system, quality can be
        measured by comparing rendered images from our project with those in the
        paper, where we will hopefully see an improvement in quality, and
        performance can be measured in the runtime of our code versus metrics
        from the paper. We will also create a demo of rendering each image with
        and without Pencil2D and comparing rendering times with the original
        paper.
      </p>
      <h3>Additional Goals</h3>
      <p>
        If we end up being ahead of schedule, we would like to animate a
        sequence of images where the light source(s) change(s) or a scene where
        there are multiple light sources. This would only be implemented after
        the baseline plan because it would require a lot more work with Pencil
        2D and would only be possible if the model created above had a high
        accuracy with shading.
      </p>
      <h2>Schedule</h2>
      <h3>Week 1</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Attempt to replicate the cel shading as-is from the paper</li>
        <li>Get accustomed to the platform and language(s) we are using</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Week 2</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Continue replicating the cel shader (we anticipate this to be the most
          difficult part, so we am allotting multiple weeks for it)
        </li>
        <li>
          Adjust the shader so that it works with a halftone design as well as
          the solid shading in the original
        </li>
      </ul>
