      <h1>Preliminary results</h1>

      <p>
        We have added two new tools to Pencil2D to support the Semi-Automated 2D Cel Shading
        technique. The first tool enables the user to add a new light source 
        and configure the direction of the light.
        The second tool performs the cell shading process on the selected object
        with a user
        
      </p>

      <h1>Progress reflection</h1>

	    <p>Our goals for the half-way point in the project was to implement all of the aspects of the semi-automatic shading tool described within the article. All of this work would be implemented with the Pencil2D. We broke this process down into different tasks: 

1. Implement a Shading Tool
2. Create two new layers attached to the shading tool - light & shade
3. The light layer should include a light source that can be maneuvered with a X,Y,Z slider and there should be a shaded sphere preview so the artist can see where the shadows would fall respective to the light sourceâ€™s position
4. Generate a spherical coordinate system to include the light source (since the light source exists in a 3D space) and implement ray intersection with the 2D image
5. Implement Far-Near Neighbor Intersection Recursive Algorithm with Set Stopping Condition
6. This implements the semi-automatic aspect of the shader using Bezier curves and the intersection algorithm
</p>

      <h1></h1>

      <h2>Progress Relative to our Plan</h2>
      <p>
        Given our initial plan, the problem that we ran into while implementing was learning how to work with Pencil2D. Given that it was a new software for all of us and there is little to no documentation on it. 
<br><br>
We were able to mostly implement the light source slider but there are some issues with the UI aspect of it. However, the shaded sphere has been implemented and will be in accordance with the paper once the light source sliders have been fully implemented.
<br><br>
The semi-automatic shading tool has been fully implemented. However, it is only shading from one light source position due to the lack of a fully implemented light source slider to move the light source in the coordinate system. 
There are some artifacts in the shading tool because there are some edge cases that haven't been accounted for. Given the T-Shirt example in the paper, there is a discontinuity between the shirt and arm, however, this shader does not yet account for that.
Additionally, we still need to add the ability to change the color of the shade based on the object's color.

      <h2>Update to our Work Plan</h2>
      <p>
        We are running slightly behind due to the time that it took to understand and navigate Pencil2D. However, we are not too far behind on our work plan, we think we will be able to fully finish everything that
we were aiming to for this milestone within the next few days. We aim to speeden up the tasks for the next steps of the project. We may not be able to implement the ambitious goal from our proposal of creating an animation but nevertheless,
we will still aim to finish the half-tone shading capabilities and multi-light sources.
